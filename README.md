# steamraces
A basic web scraper to collect player counts for some fun data analytics

Right now there are two files
steamscraper.py
steamscraper.BAT

steamscraper.py scrapes the steam game and player statistics page, depositing the data in a local instance of a mySQL server
steamscraper.BAT is my BAT file for the steamscraper to start when I log into my computer.
