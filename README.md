# steamraces
A basic web scraper to collect player counts for some fun data analytics

**Files**
1. steamscraper.py
2. steamscraper.BAT

**Purpose of each file**
1. steamscraper.py scrapes the steam game and player statistics page, depositing the data in a local instance of a mySQL server
2. steamscraper.BAT is my BAT file for the steamscraper to start when I log into my computer.
