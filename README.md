# steamraces
A basic web scraper to collect player counts for some fun data analytics

**Files**
1. steamscraper.py
2. steamscraper.BAT
3. 24hAnalysis.py

**Purpose of each file**
1. steamscraper.py scrapes the steam game and player statistics page, depositing the data in a local instance of a mySQL server
2. steamscraper.BAT is my BAT file for the steamscraper to start when I log into my computer. 
3. 24hAnalysis.py creates the visuals in Links 1 and 2

**Links to see the outcome of this work**
1. [Visualization](visualizeraces.md) of the first 24 hours with some preliminary conclusions
2. [Visualization](visualizeraces24plus.md) of 24 hours plus! This is the page that will update everyday so we can see he unweighted race unfold. 
3. Coming soon: is that cumulative sum from a linear or cyclical process?
4. Coming soon: relative contribution of each game to cyclical fluctuation in player counts
5. Coming soon: data reduction via cumulative sum slope estimation
6. Coming soon: the race in terms of 2020 vs 2021 games
7. Coming soon: the race in terms of genre
8. Coming soon: Anomalous day detection
